Ubercart Price Per Role

This module allows you to enter different sale prices per product for
different roles in an Ubercart store.

Install and enable the module as normal. In the store configuration
menu there will be a new "Price per role settings" page, here you can
select the roles for individual pricing and set a priority order for
the prices. After setting this up, the new price entry fields will be
available from the product edit pages. When viewing or adding a product
to the cart, if a role-specific price is available and the user has
that role, that price will be used. If no prices are available that
match the user's role, the standard product sell price will be used.
